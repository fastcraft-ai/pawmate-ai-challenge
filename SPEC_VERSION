v1.0.2

Changes from v1.0.1:
- Revised: docs/UI_Requirements.md to be principles-based (not implementation-specific)
  - Removed hardcoded endpoint assumptions (API chooses patterns)
  - Changed to contract-driven discovery approach
  - Maintains same 14 normative requirements (REQ-UI-0001-A through REQ-UI-0014-A)
  - Now technology-agnostic and works before API is built

Changes from v1.0.0:
- Added: docs/UI_Requirements.md - Principles-based guidance for UI-API integration
- Updated: prompts to reference UI_Requirements.md for contract-driven UI development
- No changes to core functional requirements (Master_Functional_Spec.md, API_Contract.md)
